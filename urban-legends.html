					<p class="question">Because a Cadet is not supposed to move while at the position of <em>Parade Rest</em>, he/she can respond to no other command except for <em>Attention</em>.</p>
					<p class="response">While indeed the position of <em>Parade Rest</em> calls for immobility (AFMAN 36-2203, page 19, paragraph 3.3.1.1), the manual states earlier that if an improper command is given, members will execute the maneuver to the best of their ability (page 12, paragraph 2.2.5). So, if Cadets are at <em>Parade Rest</em> and the flight commander or flight sergeant incorrectly calls a movement other than <em>Attention</em>, the Cadets should come to attention and execute the movement to the best of their ability.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">Cadets may not	drink Mountain Dew or Coffee while in uniform.</p>
					<p class="response">I initially believed there was a policy letter forbidding Cadets from consuming high-caffeine drinks such as Red Bull or Amp at Cadet Activities. This turns out to be untrue.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">ONLY Cadet Officers and NCOs may wear the service dress coat.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend; Cadets	of any grade may wear the service dress coat. See CAPM 39-1 pages 17 and 25, Note 1 on both pages. Those notes specify: �1. Grade Insignia: Cadet officers wear regular size metal grade insignia on shoulder boards; cadet NCOs and Airmen wear a metal chevron on right lapel. By this statement, it is apparent that Cadets of all ranks may indeed wear the service coat. Now, what cadets MAY POSSIBLY be keying on is the statement in CAPM 39-1 (page 15, paragraph 2-1 b.) that only SENIOR MEMBER officers and SENIOR MEMBER NCOs are allowed to wear the mess dress uniform. The mess dress is a different uniform.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">If a Cadet has too many ribbons to fit properly on the left side of his/her blue shirt, he/she may start placing ribbons on the right side over the nametag.</p>
					<p class="response">This is ENTIRELY FALSE. What an individual does if he/she has too many ribbons depends on the uniform being worn. If a Cadet is wearing a blue shirt without a service coat, a maximum of three ribbons may be worn on any row. I was incorrect about this when I said they could wear four to a row, because I said it as a blanket statement for all uniforms (I was wrong, I suck). For blue shirts, Cadets wear all or none of their ribbons. You'll find this in CAPM 39-1, pages 21 and 27, Note 4. So, if a Cadet has too many ribbons to place on his/her shirt, the cadet MUST forgo wearing his/her ribbons.If a Cadet is wearing the service coat, he/she may wear 3 or 4 ribbons to a row, which should enable the Cadet to wear all his/her ribbons. You'll find this in CAPM 39-1, pages 17 and 25, Note 4.</p>

					<p class="question">MREs contain laxatives in some form, whether it is in the chewing gum or by eating only a certain portion of the entire meal.</p>
					<p class="response">an Urban Legend even in the military. While MREs may well disagree with some people's digestive systems, there are no laxatives contained in them.</p>					
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">When Cadets raise their hands to ask a question or respond to an instructor's question, they MUST raise their clenched fist and hold their forearm vertically while the upper arm is parallel to the ground.</p>
					<p class="response">I believe this is an Urban Legend as I can find no reference to this. Once again, it is permissible for a unit to require this at the unit level if they wish, but I can find nothing that mandates it. Personally, I would prefer they raise their hands HIGH, since some of them are shorter than others and if they hold their upper arms parallel to the ground and their forearms perpendicular and with fists clenched, they can be hard to spot.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">Cadets must ask permission to ask a question.</p>
					<p class="response">While Cadets should be taught to be polite, and may need ask to see if a Senior Member or Cadet leader has time to answer a particularly detailed question, there is nothing that mandates a Cadet asking permission to ask a question. By the very nature of asking for permission, the Cadet has just asked a question. So if Cadets are required to ask permission before asking a question, a Cadet asking for permission has just ASKED A QUESTION WITHOUT PERMISSION! See where I'm going? So, rather than asking for permission to ask a question, just ASK the question.</p>					
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">Cadets must begin and end all statements to a senior Cadet or Senior Member with &quot;Sir,&quot; &quot;Ma'am,&quot; &quot;Chief,&quot; or &quot;Sergeant,&quot; as appropriate to grade and gender.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. This is referred to as a �Ma�am� or a �Sir� sandwich � the notion that the first and last words out of a Cadet�s mouth MUST be Sir or Ma�am (or Chief or Sergeant).&nbsp; For example, 
		�Sir the answer to your question is 100 to 120 steps per minute, Sir!�&nbsp; While using &quot;Sir,&quot; &quot;Ma'am,&quot; &quot;Chief,&quot; or &quot;Sergeant&quot; at the beginning OR end of statements to superiors is �highly encouraged,&quot; doing both is straight from the �Department of Redundancy Department.� There's nothing that mandates this and besides, it's silly � just answer the question.</p>

          <p class="question">When performing <em>Dress Right,</em> troops will extend their arms with their hand clenched into a fist.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. AFMAN 36-2203 page 35, paragraph 4.4.1.1 states, On the command DRESS, everyone except the last airman in each element raises and extends the left arm laterally from the shoulder with snap so the arm is parallel with the ground. As the arm is raised, uncup the hand at approximately waist level, keeping the palm down. Extend and join the fingers and place the thumb along the forefinger. Note the red underlined verbiage above; Cadets often allow their arms to &quot;droop&quot; when performing Dress Right, Dress.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">If an incorrect command is issued by an officer or NCO commanding troops for drill, members of the formation may say &quot;As you were sir/ma'am/chief/sergeant!&quot;; The commander may issue the command, &quot;As I was!&quot;</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. There are NO SUCH COMMANDS in AFMAN 36-2203. Page 12, paragraph 2.2.5 of that AFMAN states, &quot;Use the command AS YOU WERE to revoke a preparatory command. After the command of execution has been given and the movement has begun, give other appropriate commands to bring the element to the desired position. If a command is improperly given, the individuals execute the movement to the best of their ability.&quot;</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">If someone attempts to go between cadets they should raise their arms to prevent it.</p>
					<p class="response">This is an Urban Legend. There is no reference anywhere for this. Now, this doesn't mean it is ACCEPTABLE for unauthorized people to walk between people standing in formation.&nbsp; 
				The person in command of the troops should take necessary steps to get rid of the offending individual who is disrupting drill.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<p class="question">While riding in a car with a senior officer, junior officers/NCOs will remove their covers if the senior does, or leave their covers on if the senior leaves his/hers on.</p>
					<p class="response">I believe this is an Urban Legend, as I have not been able to find any official guidance in CAP or USAF publications stating this must happen.</p>

		<font face="Arial" size="4">I have found one plausible explanation for why we salute palm down, but explaining it means someone could take it as gospel and spread another Urban Legend. I have found <u><b><i>SOME</i></b></u> 
		evidence that U.S. forces (and CAP) salute with the palm down for the same reasons U.S. Navy sailors have the &quot;bibs&quot; on the back of certain uniforms. The bibs are a holdover from the days when sailors often wore their hair long and pulled it into &quot;tails&quot; in the back. They would often use various black substances to grease the tails. The bibs would protect the sailors' uniforms from getting stained, while the sailors' hands would become stained. The sailors began saluting palm down to hide their stained hands. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS AS FACT! It's a story that makes sense and there is some evidence, but no rock-solid proof.</font></p>
